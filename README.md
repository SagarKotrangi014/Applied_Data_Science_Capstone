# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone

Welcome to the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone repository! This repository contains the materials and resources for the final project of the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone course. In this course, you'll apply the knowledge and skills you've learned throughout the program to solve a real-world data science problem.

## Project Overview

The capstone project serves as the culmination of the IBM Applied Data Science specialization on Coursera. In this project, you'll have the opportunity to work on a hands-on project, applying various data science techniques to solve a real-world problem. Whether it's analyzing data, building machine learning models, or creating data visualizations, this project will showcase your proficiency in data science.

## Repository Structure

- *Notebooks:* This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project, including data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
  
- *Data:* Here you'll find the datasets used in the project. It's important to keep the data organized and documented for reproducibility.

- *Reports:* This directory contains any reports or documentation related to the project, such as project proposals, final reports, or presentation slides.

- *Scripts:* If there are any scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, or other tasks, they can be found in this directory.

## Getting Started
